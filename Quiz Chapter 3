Quiz Chapter 3
10 questions

Q1: What do we do to a Python statement that is immediately after an if statement to indicate that the statement is to be executed only when the if statement is true?
- Indent the line below the if statement (correct answer)
- Underline all of the conditional code
- Begin the statement with a curly brace {
- Start the statement with a "#" character

Q2: Which of these operators is not a comparison / logical operator?
- !=
- = (correct answer)
- <=
- >=
- ==

Q3: What is true about the following code segment:
    if  x == 5 :
    print('Is 5')
    print('Is Still 5')
    print('Third 5')
- Depending on the value of x, either all three of the print statements will execute or none of the statements will execute (correct answer)
- The string 'Is 5' will always print out regardless of the value for x.
- The string 'Is 5' will never print out regardless of the value for x.
- Only two of the three print statements will print out if the value of x is less than zero.

Q4: When you have multiple lines in an if block, how do you indicate the end of the if block?
- You omit the semicolon ; on the last line of the if block
- You de-indent the next line past the if block to the same level of indent as the original if statement (correct answer)
- You capitalize the first letter of the line following the end of the if block
- You use a curly brace { after the last line of the if block

Q5: You look at the following text:
    if x == 6 :
    print('Is 6')
    print('Is Still 6')
    print('Third 6')
    It looks perfect but Python is giving you an 'Indentation Error' on the second print statement. What is the most likely reason?
- In order to make humans feel inadequate, Python randomly emits 'Indentation Errors' on perfectly good code - after about an hour the error will just go away without any changes to your program
- Python thinks 'Still' is a mis-spelled word in the string
- You have mixed tabs and spaces in the file (correct answer)
- Python has reached its limit on the largest Python program that can be run

Q6: What is the Python reserved word that we use in two-way if tests to indicate the block of code that is to be executed if the logical test is false?
- except
- else (correct answer)
- iterate
- break

Q7: What will the following code print out?
    x = 0
    if x < 2 :
        print('Small')
    elif x < 10 :
        print('Medium')
    else :
        print('LARGE')
    print('All done')
- All done
- Small
  All done (correct answer)
- Small
  Medium
  LARGE
  All done
- LARGE
  All done
  
Q8: For the following code,
    if x < 2 :
        print('Below 2')
    elif x >= 2 :
        print('Two or more')
    else :
        print('Something else')
    What value of 'x' will cause 'Something else' to print out?
- This code will never print 'Something else' regardless of the value for 'x' (correct answer)
- x = -2.0
- x = 2.0
- x = -2

Q9: In the following code (numbers added) - which will be the last line to execute successfully?
    (1)   astr = 'Hello Bob'
    (2)   istr = int(astr)
    (3)   print('First', istr)
    (4)   astr = '123'
    (5)   istr = int(astr)
    (6)   print('Second', istr)
- 6
- 5
- 2
- 1 (correct answer)

Q10: For the following code:
    astr = 'Hello Bob'
    istr = 0
    try:
        istr = int(astr)
    except:
        istr = -1
    What will the value be for istr after this code executes?
- It will be a random number depending on the operating system the program runs on
- It will be the 'Not a number' value (i.e. NaN)
- false
- -1 (correct answer)
